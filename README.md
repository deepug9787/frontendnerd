# frontend nerd

A blog about frontend development.

## To run locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/deepug9787/frontendnerd.git

bundle update

bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Note: If you get an error at this point, it might be because webrick is missing from your
dependencies. You can add that by running `bundle add webrick`. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` again.

Once the local server is up and running, open http://localhost:4000/frontendnerd/ in your browser to
view the site.
